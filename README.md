# CryoEM-GB-workflow-analysis
Analysis of workflow runs for the CryoEM-MD-AI Gordon Bell Submission


production-thetagpu-0 : the first cross site run where we had big reservation on both systems, but ThetaGPU was lagging a lot
perlmutter-production-final: the Thursday night run with only 1 GPU on Theta for AI; and 40 nodes going fast on Perlmutter (bottlenecked by tarring!)
production-cross2: Friday morning's new run with 4 Theta nodes + 40 perlmutter (we think we fixed stuff)
